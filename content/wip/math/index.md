With the introduction of the STRK provisions program, Starknet has garnered significant public attention, sparking a growing curiosity regarding its technical intricacies. Particularly, there exists a notable gap in understanding the architecture of Starknet and the mechanics of L1-L2 messaging. Thus, the purpose of this writing is to provide a comprehensive elucidation of these two topics.

$ \sin(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n + 1)!} x^{2n + 1} $
\\[ r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}} \\]
