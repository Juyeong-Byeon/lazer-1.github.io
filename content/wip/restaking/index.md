# Retail

- Retail vs Web3 natives
- What is even retail? Regardless, users tend to grow speculative and aggressive/experimentative on investment

# Dimensions of Risks and how to manage those

- The real risks will only be realized only when slashing goes live
- Algorithmic risk curation is going to be useful
- Validators are relatively easier to run (only abide by the rules on double proposal, double spending, etc).
- AVS are different. They are programmable; More risks. More slashing rules. Complicated rules to be designed. 
- It's a tradeoff between one rule/risk and big token vs various risks/rules and many different tokens
- For most users, there might be a happy compromise, a sweet spot. Low-risk and long-term perspective.

- Design is not mature yet
- How do users make sure that they are exposed to less risk?
- Spread across multiple restaking protocols - Karak, Symbiotic, EigenLayer, etc? Will be wise to do so to spread risk. But need some heavy lifting from BE/SC side.

# Concerns

Decision making left to LRT
1. which AVS to support
2. how much ETH for each AVS
3. what's the overlap? same ETH for 20 AVS's or a single AVS?

No mechanism to handle price drops and increase the supply of underlying token accordingly as of now and it's probablty not gonna happen. But is there a better way to do it?

# How much security does your AVS really need?

## A tripariate tale
1. Restkaing is a decentralized matching market
2. Minimum amount of secure to pay for is quantified is cascading risks
3. Optimal rewards depends on choice of threat model.

## Matching market
Main idea: 
1. inhomogenous goods with some properties.
2. demand side has some preconditions.

- Kidney exchanges: can't take arbitrary kidney, but every kidney is a kidney. 
- Hospital <> Resident Matching
- Dating apps

## Matching vs Auctions

## Why decentralized matching markets are harder to analyze

- Permissionless means you might get unmatched.

# Restaking graphs & cascades

# Dual staking: securing networks with multi tokens

Slashing in Ethereum, report from Lido - slashing does happen! But Lido covers it using its treasury. But it really happens.

Multi-token staking complicates the whole thing

At this stage, lots of AVS's and operators are very new. Prone to slashing. The whole landscape of multi-token staking protocol is different. reAlt on MACH AVS.

Not all tokens are equal. Volatility, liquidity, native, foreign, risks.

Is USDC the best asset for restaking? It depends on the economic security and the amount of TVL you can slash.
